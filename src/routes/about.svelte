    Hello there 👋
    <br />
    nice to see you here!
  </p>

  <p>
    As

      target="_blank"

      I'm
    </a>
    working on this app, I would like to address some likely to be asked
    questions
  </p>

    <h2>FAQ 🤔</h2>

    <h3>What is this project about?</h3>
    <p>
      The idea of this site is to collactivly provide information on queer (and
      non queer) identities in one place. It covers different fields and is
      supposed to work as a starting point to talk about these complicated
      topics.
      <br />
      In my opinion having a common foundation in our everyday language is key
      to improve how we treat one another in a society, now and in the future.
      Having a place to quickly check up definitions could help us to achieve
      just that.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this project politically motivated?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, and no. While I follow my own ideals and concepts, I see this site
      mainly as an information platform that is not supposed to be opiononated.
      <br />
      That being said, the content of this page is moderated to keep the content
      credible and trolls out.
      <br />
      Rule of thumb: Be nice. 🤗💙
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of language do you use?</h3>
    <p>
      I try to keep everything gender neutral or at least gender inclusive. For
      some descriptions this is pretty hard. So please feel free to
      <a href="/about/#contribute">improve</a>
      the wording and content.
      <br />
      To achieve gender neutral/inclusive language, I've decided to use singluar
      "they". If this sounds strange to you, that's ok. However please be
      respectful and accept my choice. If you want to find out more about
      singluar "they" here's
      <a rel="external" href="https://iheartsingularthey.com/" target="blank">
        a good and entertaining resource
      </a>
      for that.
      <br />
      In some occations I also rely on using the asterisks (*) to indicate
      people who aren't automatically associated with certain terms or who sort
      of fall inbetween categories.
      <br />
      This is often known as the gender star.
    </p>

    <h3>Who decides what makes it into the listings?</h3>
    <p>
      For now, that's
      <a
        rel="external"
        href="https://www.twitter.com/diverent2"
        target="blank"
        title="@diverent2 on twitter">
        me.
      </a>
      To do so, I research the content and try not to be too opionated while
      also trying my hardest to keep the list organised and clean.
      <br />
      You can also
      <a href="/about/#contribute">contribute</a>

      First of: More content.
